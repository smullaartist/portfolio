                        Home is an abandoned orphanage set in the late 1900s. This was the project 
                        I ended up submitting as my final year assignment. The game's premise was 
                        that you played as a detective, attempting to unravel the mystery of why 
                        this orphanage was abandoned. To solve this mystery, the player needed to 
                        find all of the paper cranes scattered throughout the environment which 
                        each told the player some information about its abandonment. Despite the 
                        challenges that came with this project, I had a lot of fun working on it 
                        and would love to create something on a bigger scale in the future. All 
                        the environments, models (some) and textures were made by myself using MAYA, 
                        Substance Painter, and Unreal Engine 5.

                    This project wasn't game-focused, so I didn't spend too much time implementing mechanics. 
                    The game featured three main mechanics: picking up objects (keys), using those keys to unlock 
                    previously inaccessible areas (doors), and reading information on a UI by clicking on objects 
                    (paper cranes). The goal of the game was to find all the paper cranes scattered across the 
                    environment. Each crane contained a letter or written document providing the player with 
                    information about why the orphanage was abandoned and being able to piece together what happened, 
                    once the player had found them all. Although I could have made the game more immersive and 
                    implemented various narrative techniques, the main focus was on the environment and I feel 
                    satisfied with the minimal yet effective gameplay decisions I made.

                    When creating this environment, I took heavy inspiration from Capcom's Resident Evil 2, particularly it's orphanage. It features three distinct sections: the entrance hall, 
                    bedroom, and kitchen. I undertook the modeling and texturing of the environment of most assets, except for a few models sourced online, which I then retextured. Throughout 
                    the texturing process, I maintained a consistent theme of age and wear, ensuring that it conveyed the abandoned, aesthetic I was aiming for. Although I made considerable 
                    efforts, I feel I could have further enhanced the aged and worn aesthetic by incorporating more damage and wear directly into the geometry.
